# Design a Stock Exchange System

Design a stock exchange system that allows traders to buy and sell stocks in a secure and efficient manner.
The system should support real-time trading and provide up-to-date information on market trends, stock prices, and other relevant data. 
The system should also be scalable to handle large volumes of transactions and support multiple user accounts. 
Consider security measures such as authentication and encryption to protect user information and prevent fraudulent activity. 
Additionally, consider incorporating features such as trading algorithms, historical data analysis, and automated trading. 
Finally, think about how the system will integrate with other financial systems and services to provide a seamless trading experience for users.
